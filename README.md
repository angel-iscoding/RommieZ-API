## Quick Start with JSON Server

1. Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
	```bash
	npm install
	```

2. Make sure you have a `db.json` file in the project root (an example is already included).

3. Start the JSON server:
	```bash
	npm run start-json
	```

4. Access the REST API at: [http://localhost:3099](http://localhost:3099)

You can edit the `db.json` file to customize the mock data.
